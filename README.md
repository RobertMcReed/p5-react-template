# Getting Started with p5-react-template

1. Create a new project by using this template by clicking [here](https://github.com/RobertMcReed/p5-react-template/generate)
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Start the app with `yarn start`
4. Update the `setup()` and `draw()` functions to create your animations

## Merging Updates

If there are changes to the template that you wish to pull in you can do so as follows:

1. Run `yarn add-remote` to add the template remote to git (only needs to be run once)
2. Run `yarn merge-remote` to pull in all updates from the remote. This will likely require you to fix merge conflicts.
